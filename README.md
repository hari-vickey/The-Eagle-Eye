## Problem Statement

<p align="justify">
Behind the scenes in the e-commerce industry lies a sophisticated system of automation and robotics to help bring down costs and deliver goods to customers at the fastest speeds possible. Flipkart's current upcoming facility - expected to be one of the largest in Asia, has a throughput of over 40,000 units/hour. They are constantly looking for ways to increase our scale and speed while trying to minimize cost.

1. A central monitoring/navigation system (such as a camera or multiple cameras) should be used to understand the arena and the position of the robots and instruct robots on actions to be taken.
2. Swarm algorithms for maximizing the throughput of the given systems.

## The Eagle Eye

<p align="justify">
For the given problem statement, we have designed a central monitoring system based on ROS. The developed system can determine the position of the bot using the camera mounted on the top. Then, the A* algorithm is applied to determine the shortest path for traversal. The communication between the bot and ROS is seamlessly carried out using the ROS socket server. Once the bot reaches the destination, packages are deposited using the servo motor mounted inside the bot.
