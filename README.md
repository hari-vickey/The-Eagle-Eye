# Flipkart GRiD 3.0

The Flipkart GRiD 3.0 Robotics Challenge is all set to test the students on their technical, analytical, and ideation skills before they present their unique solutions to the panel of domain experts at Flipkart. The Flipkart GRiD 3.0 Robotics Challenge will assess your skills in the field of analytics and robotics.

## Problem Statement

Behind the scenes in the e-commerce industry lies a sophisticated system of automation and robotics to help bring down costs and deliver goods to customers at the fastest speeds possible. Flipkart current upcoming facility - expected to be one of the largest in Asia, has a throughput of over 40,000 units/hour. They are constantly looking for ways to increase our scale and speed while trying to minimize cost. That brings us to a problem that we have solved but looking at ways in which you can innovate. You can visit https://stories.flipkart.com/bots-agv-ecommerce/ to see what Flipkart expert's are working on.

1. A central monitoring/navigation system (such as a camera or multiple cameras) should be used to understand the arena and the position of the robots and instruct robots on actions to be taken.
2. Swarm algorithms for maximizing the throughput of the given systems.

## The Eagle Eye

Our Team Comprises of team members from various engineering domains to formulate the solution for the given problem statement. This repository has all the codes that are being added, developed, validated are added. So, that the team can share their work easily and update themselves.

We have tried our best to get to the Finals of the competition but we have ended up in completing all the stages(1 & 2) of the competition.
